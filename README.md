## 🎯 Why This Design?

### Camera as Reference (Not OCR)
- **Problem:** OCR on nutrition labels is unreliable (complex layouts, small text)
- **Solution:** Use photos as visual reference while entering data manually
- **Benefit:** 100% accuracy, no API costs, works offline

### Step-by-Step Wizard
- **Problem:** Long forms are overwhelming
- **Solution:** Break into 3 clear steps
- **Benefit:** Better UX, higher completion rate

### Bulk Buying Support
- **Problem:** Comparing different sizes is confusing
- **Solution:** Track container size, servings, serving size
- **Benefit:** Accurate comparison across any product size

## 💡 Pro Tips

| Tip | Why |
|-----|-----|

| Include tax in price | For accurate total cost |
| Check protein per serving | Some brands use small servings |
| Consider amino acids | Not all proteins are complete |
| Whole foods often win | Chicken, eggs often cheaper than powder |
